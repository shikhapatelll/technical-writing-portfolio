# PawTopia — Virtual Pet Game (Team Project)  
**Documentation & QA Portfolio** · Java (Swing) · JSON · Git/GitHub  

This repository is a **technical writing portfolio** created from a university team project. It highlights how I document a software product from **requirements → design → data format → testing**.

## What you'll find here
- **User-facing guidance**: quickstart + how-to-play (summarized in Markdown)
- **Engineering docs**: development environment + design notes + patterns overview
- **Data format**: JSON rationale + save/load notes
- **Testing artifacts**: test plan + integration/system/validation testing documentation (with traceability-style structure)

> Note: Some original artifacts are included as PDFs under `source_pdfs/` (exported from a GitLab wiki / course deliverables).  
> This repo focuses on *documentation quality and structure* rather than shipping the full codebase.

## Docs index (start here)
- `docs/user-guide.md` — Setup and how to play
- `docs/requirements-summary.md` — Requirements and key behaviors (summary)
- `docs/dev-environment.md` — Tooling, build/test workflow
- `docs/data-format/json-save-format.md` — JSON save/load format + validation guidance
- `docs/testing/` — Test plan + test levels (integration/system/validation)

## Source artifacts (PDF exports)
- Requirements: `source_pdfs/requirements/`
- Design + data format: `source_pdfs/design/`
- Testing: `source_pdfs/testing/`

## Skills demonstrated (technical writing internship aligned)
- Structured documentation: audience, scope, prerequisites, procedures, expected results
- Turning specs into testable behavior (test cases, expected outcomes, pass/fail recording)
- Cross-functional doc style: developer-facing (data formats/APIs) + user-facing (how-to guides)
- Clear organization + docs-as-code repo structure
