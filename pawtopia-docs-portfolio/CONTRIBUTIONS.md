# Contributions (Portfolio)

This repo is a portfolio representation of a team project. My contributions focused on **documentation + QA artifacts**, including:
- Development environment/tooling documentation
- Design documentation support (UML/class-diagram documentation and pattern rationale)
- Testing documentation (test plan + integration/system/validation test write-ups)
- Data-format documentation (JSON rationale and save/load notes)

If you need a more detailed “what I wrote” breakdown (per document section), I can provide it.
