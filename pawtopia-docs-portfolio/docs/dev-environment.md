# Development Environment

## Tooling (typical setup)
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
- Build: Maven/Gradle (depending on build configuration)
- Testing: JUnit (unit/integration/system-level tests)
- Version control: Git (team workflow on GitLab during the course)

## Repo workflow (docs-as-code)
- Keep documentation close to the work: design decisions, data formats, and testing artifacts versioned alongside changes.
- Use short, reviewable updates (PR-style edits) and maintain a changelog when possible.
