# User Guide (Summary)

## Quickstart
1. Launch the game (Java desktop app).
2. Create/select a pet profile.
3. Keep your pet healthy by regularly performing actions such as **feed**, **play**, **groom**, and **rest**.
4. Use **Save** to persist progress and **Load** to resume later.

## Core gameplay loop
- The game is built around maintaining your pet’s **well-being** over time.
- Pet stats decrease gradually if the pet is idle, encouraging consistent care.
- As you play, you unlock progression elements (mini-games/achievements may apply depending on build).

## Save/Load behavior
- Players can **save progress** and continue across multiple sessions.
- The pet’s condition remains persistent to support a long-term care experience.

## Common issues
- If a save file is missing or corrupted, the game should handle the error gracefully (see: JSON Save Format + Testing docs).
