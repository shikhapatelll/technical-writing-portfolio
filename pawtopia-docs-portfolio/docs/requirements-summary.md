# Requirements Summary (Portfolio)

This is a condensed, recruiter-friendly summary of the project requirements and key behaviors.

## Functional themes
- **Pet status management:** the pet has multiple status attributes (for example health/hunger/happiness/energy).
- **Actions:** players perform actions such as feed/play/groom/rest to influence stats.
- **Progression:** gameplay encourages long-term engagement (rewards/achievements/mini-games may apply depending on build).
- **Persistence:** **Save/Load** across sessions so the player can continue caring for the same pet.

## Non-functional themes
- **Usability:** clear UI labels, predictable navigation, responsive feedback.
- **Reliability:** robust handling of invalid inputs and file-related errors.
- **Maintainability:** modular design with documented patterns and test coverage.
